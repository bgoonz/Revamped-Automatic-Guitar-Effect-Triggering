    <h2>Pd Documentation chapter 4: writing Pd objects in C</h2>

    <p>
      You can write your own objects that you and others can use in their Pd
      applications. You can write them in C or (if you're smart and brave) in
      C++ or FORTRAN.
    </p>

    <p>HOW EXTERNS ARE LOADED</p>

    <p>
      Whenever you type the name of an object (into an "object" text box) that
      Pd doesn't yet know about, Pd looks for a relocatable object file, named,
      for instance, "profile.pd_irix5". Pd looks first in the directory
      containing the patch, then in directories in its "path." Pd will then add
      whatever object is defined there to its "class list," which is the set of
      all Pd classes you can use. If all this works, Pd then attempts again to
      create the object you asked for, this time perhaps successfully. There is
      no difference between an object defined this way and an object built into
      Pd.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you load a new object into Pd, it's there for the duration of your Pd
      session. If you load another Pd document which supplies a different
      version of some Pd object, the object won't be updated. IF you're working
      on a new object and decide to change it, you have to exit and re-enter Pd
      to get the change to take.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the "externs" subdirectory of the documentation you can find simple
      examples of "externs" with their source code and test patches; there are
      many other on the web (see <a href="x1.htm#s2">section 1.2 </a>).
